		<h3>QoS Overview</h3>
		<p>
			We are upgrading to more and more 100G links both in the CORE and backhaul from remote PoPs.
		</p>
		<p>
			QoS will allow us to make better use of these more expensive 100G links, by combining services (Carrier, Voice,
			Enterprise, Internet, etc) on these links.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the past we have thrown bandwidth and dedicated links at the issue, VZW Overlay. This was quicker and simpler
			to accomplish at the expense of cost.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally with the QoS design it should give us a way to help mitigate DDoS attacks.
